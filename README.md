Task :To build a stopwatch web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. By implementing functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times, users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities, you can create an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application.

# Approach:
Create one container in which all the elements are present.
Inside this container add 2 divs that contain all time elements like an hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and another div contains 3 buttons for start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
Now add Styles to center the div container.
Next, add a JavaScript file in which we will add onclick functions on all three buttons and create another function in which write all the logical code and add value to corresponding hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, etc.

# HTML:
Element separation for improved DOM manipulation.
# CSS:
Styles the stopwatch interface.
Centers the stopwatch on the screen using flexbox.
Sets colors, font sizes, and button styles to create a visually appealing design
# javascript
Manages the stopwatch functionality.
Defines variables to track hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (count).
Implements event listeners for the Start, Stop, and Reset buttons.
The stopWatch function updates the time display every 10 milliseconds when the stopwatch is running, and the buttons control the start, stop, and reset actions
